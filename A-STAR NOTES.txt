NAv-Mesh - most efficient

BrethFurst Search ( used to find closesest powerup , fewest steps possible)
while( CurrNode != EndNode)
	{
		add children to fringe ( as long as they arnt enclosed)
		choose element in front of fringe to be current node
		add current node to closed list;
	}
	
Dijkstra Algorithm 	
{ 
	uses path weights..
}

A-Star 
{
	diaganal ( euclidean space, requires root calculation)
	uses mahattan distance as an extra weight
	g cost-Distance From source
	h cost-Distance To Final
}
